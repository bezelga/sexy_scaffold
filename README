Sexy Scaffold
============


better than rspec_haml_scaffold
- support for model values upon generation, creates fixtuers as well
- this fork has dependancy for resource controlle, if you want you can use my template to create a new rails project with it configured and another things too, take a look at:

http://github.com/bezelga/mytemplates/tree/master

better than make_resourcesful
- creates scaffolded specs for controllers, models and views
- uses sexy migrations for models

notes
when using script/destroy on nested controllers you must destroy the nest like

ruby script/destroy rest_scaffold yoda/bob
